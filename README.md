# Kickstar-Text-mining-project
Kickstarter is an American public-benefit corporation based in Brooklyn, New York, that maintains a global crowd funding platform focused on creativity. The company’s stated mission is to “help bring creative projects to life”. Kickstarter has reportedly received almost $6 billion in pledges from 19.4 million backers to fund 200,000 creative projects, such as films, music, stage shows, comics, journalism, video games, technology and food-related projects.
